#### Old Version Code

- The old version code can be found in the branch: [asd123pwj/asdTools at ShitCode_deprecated](https://github.com/asd123pwj/asdTools/tree/ShitCode_deprecated)
- Thirty-two files were written, but they were often written temporarily for a certain purpose, the time was rushed, the readability was poor, and there were not many comments, so they were all deleted. The new version was refactored and the comments will be done by GPT.
