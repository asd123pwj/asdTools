# AsdTools

#### A few notes

- This is my first time using Git to manage a repository, so there may be some issues. If you encounter any problems, please open an issue.

## Update History

#### Refactor

- 2023/05/03 - V0.0.1: Testing push.

#### Old Code

- The old code can be found in the branch: [asd123pwj/asdTools at ShitCode_deprecated](https://github.com/asd123pwj/asdTools/tree/ShitCode_deprecated)
- I wrote thirty-two files, but they were often written for temporary purposes and had poor readability due to time constraints. They also had very few comments. Therefore, they were all deleted, and a new version was refactored with the help of GPT for comments.
