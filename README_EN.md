# AsdTools

#### Some notes

- This is the first time I'm using Git to manage a repository, so there might be some issues. If it affects you, please create an issue.

## Features

#### Context menu items

- See [Readme](Tools2ContextMenu\Readme.md) for details.

1. ImageResizer_256x144: Resize images to 256x144 resolution.

## Update history

#### Refactoring

- 2023/05/03 - V0.0.1: Test push.
- 2023/05/05 - V0.0.2: Add shortcut to quickly resize images to 256x144 and add to right-click context menu.

#### Old code

- Old code can be found in branch: [asd123pwj/asdTools at ShitCode_deprecated](https://github.com/asd123pwj/asdTools/tree/ShitCode_deprecated)
- I wrote 32 files, but they were often written temporarily for a specific purpose and had poor readability due to time constraints and lack of comments. Therefore, I deleted them and refactored the new version, and GPT will help with the comments.
